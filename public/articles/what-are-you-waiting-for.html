                    <h1>What is risk?</h1>
                    <p>Risk, according to Wikipedia, is the possibility of something bad happening. Seems like it's obvious - bad things are bad, and therefore should be avoided. Most people try their best to avoid as many risks as they possibly can.</p>
                    <p>I don't quite agree with that way of living: For me, risks aren't necessarily a bad thing - they're simply a necessary means to achieve growth and progress and as such should be considered, but not avoided at all costs.</p>
                    <h1>My approach</h1>
                    <p>Here's how I consider and balance risks:</p>
                    <p>I'm willing to take any risk, as long as there is no danger of imminent death, serious injury or other serious consequences to my life (or others').</p>
                    <p>Risks should only be considered when they pose an objective and imminent threat of a certain intensity. In all other cases, they're primarily a cause of unnecessary anxieties.</p>
                    <p>What is stopping you of doing something you've always wanted? In most cases it's probably a risk that is actually pretty minor. Ask yourself: What is the worst thing that could happen? If the answer isn't death, injury or prison, I'd mostly ignore whatever risk you're thinking of. Why? Most other things can be fixed - more money can be made, exams can be retaken etc.</p>
