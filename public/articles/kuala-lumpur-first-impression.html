                <h1>Kuala Lumpur: Initial thoughts</h1>
                <p>I just arrived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and after having explored a few parts of the city, I have to say: I love this place! There are so many different things to do, so many different food options and it's affordable too.</p>
                <p>KL actually reminds me a lot of Singapore - it's very green, there are parks and trees everywhere. Also, the traffic is not that bad compared to Bangkok, Jakarta etc. Most people I've encountered spoke English very well, which makes connecting with locals a lot easier.</p>
                <p>Kuala Lumpur also seems to be a lot more diverse than Bangkok; there is no clear division of "local" and "foreigner" here. People here have various cultural backgrounds - Malays, people of Chinese and Indian descent, Westerners and many more.</p>
                <p>This also makes the food great! Especially for me as a vegetarian, there are tons of Indian options! And just like in any other big city, you can basically find anything you could think of in terms of food. And it's affordable too - for a full Mexican menu I paid about 70 MYR, which is about $15. Street food is even cheaper.</p>
                <p>Taxis are cheap and easily available too, and there is an extensive public transport network. The city is also pretty walkable - even though no one really seems to walk, it is possible: There are sidewalks (and they're in good shape) and there are a lot of elevated, covered walkways connecting LRT stations, intersections etc.</p>
                <p>I haven't really seen too much of the city, but I definitely like the general vibe of this place. I could see myself living here too! :)</p>
                <p>Here are some photos:</p>
