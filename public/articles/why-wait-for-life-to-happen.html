                <p>Lots of people like to wait, for all sort of things. I don't mean like waiting in line to get the new iPhone, or waiting to board a plane. The kind of waiting for things that you've already decided you want to do, but haven't done yet for some reason.</p>
                <p>We all have that one person in our family that has been talking about starting their own business for years. Or the couple that has been talking about moving abroad forever - but they have never done it. Here's what I have to say about that.</p>
                <h1>Life is now.</h1>
                <p>I hate that kind of waiting. Why? Because life is now, and that's all we've got! You never know what's going to happen in the next few years, months, weeks or even days. Who knows - maybe you'll get hit by a car tomorrow and die! Or you'll suddenly fall terribly ill and be stuck in bed for the rest of your life. Good luck travelling the world and doing all those amazing things you've always dreamed of doing then!</p>
                <p>That's why you should do things now. This isn't a call to take crazy risks and move to Australia tomorrow - but just get started now. Stop talking, and take a little action. Book that flight - it can be next year, but just book it. Start reading a book about that skill you've always wanted to learn, just one page at a time. Take action, and you'll get there. But stop waiting for the universe to magically figure everything out for you.</p>
                <h1>Retirement</h1>
                <p>Retirement is a concept that I never understood. I'm supposed to work 40 years in a career I don't like just to pay the bills and afford 4 weeks of vacation to escape the life I hate? And then maybe when I'm 65 (and basically dead), I'll maybe get to enjoy life? What a joke!</p>
                <p>A guy I know really worked hard for his retirement, saved up a lot of money and made lots of plans for after. Within a year of retiring, he got brain cancer, forgot who his family members were, lost most of his bodily functions and eventually died.</p>
                <p>That's why we should choose to be happy every day of our very limited time on this planet! Live every day to the fullest; retirement won't be the answer to "finally finding happiness"! If you want to do something, you gotta do it now!</p>
