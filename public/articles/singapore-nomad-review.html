                    Singapore is a prosperous but tiny city state in South East Asia - often called the "New York of Asia", it's one of the world's financial hubs. Singapore is also one of the most diverse countries: Around 75% of Singaporeans are of Chinese descent, but there are also big Malay, Indian and Western communities. It's hot all year around with lots of rain during the summer months. 
                    </p>
                    <p>But how's Singapore for digital nomads? This is a short guide of the pros and cons of being a nomad in Singapore. Enjoy! :)</p>

                    <h1>Living expenses</h1>
                    <p>One of the most important factors of "nomad destinations" is obviously the cost of living. Unfortunately, Singaore does not do well in this category - it's extremely expensive! A big part of that is housing - you should expect to pay at least <span class="highlight">$1500 per month</span> for a studio or small one bedroom apartment. Rent in Singapore is comparable to cities like New York, Zurich and San Francisco!</p>
                    <p>Food & transport is generally more affordable. You can get decent street food at a hawker stall (Singapore's famous food courts) for less than $10. Transport is pretty cheap too - a ride on the amazing metro network is only around $2. Taxis (like Grab, Gojek etc.) are more expensive than in countries like Thailand, but still cheaper than e.g. Uber in the US. A ride from the airport to downtown is around 15$, depending on the time. <span class="highlight">Warning: It's extremely hard to get a taxi (Grab) in the evening!</span> Do not rely on taxis to get back home after a long night out (I've waited two hours for a taxi in downtown at 2am!). </p>
                    <h1>Nomad lifestyle</h1>
                    <p>My favourite part about Singapore was that I fit in! Singapore has a <span class="highlight">big expat community</span>, so nobody bats an eye at a white person walking around. Also, pretty much everyone speaks English, so you'll fit in perfectly.</p>
                    <p>There isn't as big of a nomad community like in "nomad hotspots" like Chiang Mai or Bali - but there are plenty of cool coworking spaces (lots of WeWork, and some "boutique" ones too) to make friends at. And again, it's really easy to connect with locals because everyone speaks English.</p>

                    <p>If you work online like me, you've got nothing to worry about. The WiFi is fast and reliable, and there is free WiFi basically everywhere. Mobile data is affordable too.</p>
                    <h1>Quality of life & fun</h1>
                    <p>How is life in Singapore like outside work? There are a lot of things to do and see in Singapore - for example, the Gardens by the Bay, all the different sections of town (Little India, Orchard, Arab Town, Chinatown etc.), outskirts of town, or you could even do a quick trip to Johor Bahru in Malaysia. Singapore is also very green - so if you're into cycling, running or anything like that, there are a lot of opportunities. There are also some nice beaches on Sentosa Island to relax on.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Singapore's party scene is alright - there are <span class="highlight">a few cool clubs with big parties on the weekends.</span> They are expensive, the music is okay and you'll see a lot of locals that had too much to drink ;-). But if you're looking to go to a different (and good) club every night, Singaore is not the place for you. It's pretty small after all!</p>
                    <p>That's also Singapore's biggest drawback: Just that it's small! There isn't all that much to do after you've seen the big attractions. <span class="highlight">It can get boring quickly.</span> I think Singapore is a good nomad spot for a few weeks, but not too much longer.</p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Singapore is a great city that is definitely worth visiting. However, the horrendous prices (especially for rent) and the limited amount of things to do make it more suitable for a shorter stay. Other cities in Asia (like Bangkok) offer more at a lower cost.</p>
