                <p>For the last few months, I've dealt with feeling overwhelmed on quite a few occasions. I'm sure everyone can relate - sometimes we all feel lost, overwhelmed, maybe even a little scared. Navigating this giant maze called "life" can be challenging at times. Here's a bit of self-reflection on my feelings and how I'm dealing with them. Hope you enjoy :-)</p>
                <h1>Where do these feelings come from?</h1>
                <p>Well, my life has taken quite a few unexpected turns this year. I decided to make Bangkok my "base", which meant renting a flat in this huge city and managing the challenges of living on my own for the first time, making new friends etc. At the same time, I decided to kickstart my freelance career in a field I felt entirely unqualified for (which lead to a lot of <span class="underlined">imposter syndrome</span>). I also still had my studies going on, plus a lot of personal projects I'm always working on.</p>
                <p>So many things to do - I felt (and still sometimes feel) like I'm constalty behind everything, I'm always chasing things that should've been done yesterday. Sometimes I couldn't sleep because my mind was just racing, thinking about what else there is to do. This is definitely not healthy - here are five ways I've found to deal with it:</p>
                <h3>1. Following a schedule</h3>
                <p>This gave me a lot of peace of mind: Simply setting (and following) a rough schedule. For example, Monday is when we're having our weekly team meeting at <span class="underlined">Mileways</span>. I'm always attending that, no matter what. It doesn't matter where I am on this planet, as long as I have WiFi I'll be there. When I have a full work week without any travel, I'll also work on Mileways the whole day. This makes things a lot easier - I always know what to do on Monday mornings. I have a clear priority for this day, it doesn't matter what else happens. I'll only work for other clients on Mondays after my work on Mileways is done. I won't respond to any other emails - I think you get the point.</p>
