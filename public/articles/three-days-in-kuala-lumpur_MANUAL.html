          I recently had the pleasure of visiting Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Here's how I
          spent my three days in the city! If you want to read about my first impression
          of KL, you can do that
          <span
            class="underlined font-medium cursor-pointer"
            onclick="parent.open(window.location='kuala-lumpur-first-impression')"
            >here.</span
          >
          <br />
          My itinerary was pretty relaxed because I also spent a lot of time working on a
          project, so you could probably fit more things into three days. But here's what
          I did:
        </p>
        <h1>Day 1: Arriving & Petronas Towers</h1>
        <h3>Getting to the city</h3>
        <p>
          Most people will probably arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA,
          KUL) which is the biggest airport in KL. There are two main options to get to
          the city:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>By car - Taxi or Grab - 1h <span class="nowrap">(RM 65)</span></li>
          <li>
            Public transport: KLIA Transit - 1h 25 to KL Sentral
            <span class="nowrap">(RM 55)</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I took a taxi to my hotel, the Sheraton Imperial. The main reason was that the
          JW Marriott, which would've been my first choice, didn't have any availabilty on
          the first night. The Sheraton was very good too, it was recently renovated and
          their Club Lounge is great.
        </p>

            <imgtitle>KL Tower</imgtitle>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Petronas Towers / KLCC</h3>
        <p>
          After getting some food I took a Grab to KLCC Park, and decided to walk to the
          Petronas Towers. It's not that big, around 1/3 the size of Bangkok's Lumphini
          Park. It's calm to walk around though, and there is even a jogging track if you
          can deal with the heat. It's pretty dark though at night.
        </p>
        <p>There are a couple of things to do around the KLCC area:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Petronas Towers: KL's iconic twin towers. They're lit up at night, and there
            is an observation deck (09:00 - 21:00). A reservation is required though, and
            they're usually sold out a few days before.
          </li>
          <li>Suria KLCC, a giant shopping mall with tons of shopping options</li>
          <li>
            The SkyBar at the Traders Hotel for amazing views of the Petronas Towers
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          KLCC is also close to Saloma Link, a popular bridge that lights up in different
          colors at night.
        </p>

        <h1>Day 2: Exploring & KL Tower</h1>
        <p>
          On the second day, I spent some time exploring the city. I started off at
          Independence Square, where the Sultan Abdul Samad Building is located. It was
          home to numerous British agencies during the British rule, and currently houses
          some ministries of the Malaysian government. I also walked around the Sri
          Mahamariamman Temple, another one of KL's recognizable spots.
        </p>
        <div
          class="sd:flex-col sd:space-x-0 space-y-8 lg:space-y-0 lg:space-x-4 lg:flex article-img">

            <imgtitle>Sri Mahamariamman Temple</imgtitle>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          But the higlight was definitely my visit to KL Tower. I'ts 421 meters tall,
          which makes it the world's 7th tallest tower. There are multiple observation
          decks with an amazing view, and there is also a revolving restaurant on one of
          the upper floors. You can see both the Petronas Towers / KLCC, as well as the
          new mega-tall Merdeka 118 skyscraper (the world's second largest building).
          Absolutely fantastic!
        </p>
        <div
          class="sd:flex-col sd:space-x-0 space-y-8 lg:space-y-0 lg:space-x-4 lg:flex article-img">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I highly recommend a visit to KL Tower and one of its observation decks. Tickets
          are usually easier to get than for the Petronas Towers and the view is amazing!
        </p>
        <h1>Day 3: Batu Caves</h1>
        <p>
          On the second day, I first went to walk around the Perdana Botanical Garden.
          It's a huge park with small lakes, fountains and lots of plants of course! You
          can walk around and explore the many attractivions like a deer park, the
          Hibiscus and the Orchid garden. There is also a butterfly park.
        </p>

          class="sd:flex-col sd:space-x-0 space-y-8 lg:space-y-0 lg:space-x-4 lg:flex article-img">

            <imgtitle>Perdana Botanical Gardens (2)</imgtitle>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I then took a Grab to another famous KL attraction: The Batu Caves! And I was
          not disappointed - they look absolutely stunning. Go there during or right
          before sunset, there'll be less people and the soft light makes everything look
          nice.
        </p>
        <div
          class="sd:flex-col sd:space-x-0 space-y-8 lg:space-y-0 lg:space-x-4 lg:flex article-img">
          <div style="flex: calc(1365 / 2048)">
            <img src="../img/articles/kuala-lumpur-batu-caves-2.jpg" alt="" />
            <imgtitle>Stairs</imgtitle>

            <imgtitle>Entrance to the caves</imgtitle>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you want to get to the entrance, you'll need to walk up a few stairs. It's
          pretty steep but fun, and there are some funny monkeys along the way too. I
          didn't actually go inside the caves because I was super hungry - there is a guy
          selling ice cream and drinks up there if you need some sugar before walking back
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it - this are some of the things I did during my three days online. If
          you get bored, here are some more recommendations: Jalan Alor for food and
          Pavilion & The Gardens Mall for shopping. Or go have a look at one of the many
          mosques in KL!
