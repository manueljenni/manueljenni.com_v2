                    <p>I'm sure you've heard this question before - what would you do if you had a billion dollars? What would you do with your life if money wouldn't matter? Or another version: What would you do if you were terminally ill and only had one year to live?</p>
                    <p>Of course, these questions aren't meant to be taken literally. But answers to these kind of questions can reveal our true priorities and what we truly value.</p>
                    <p>Many people live their lifes like on autopilot, they just do what they've been taught to do and follow the paths that their parents, society or whatever lays out for them.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, if you live like this your life will just fly by and you'll be 80 years old, asking yourself <i>"How did I get here so fast? Why didn't I do all those things I dreamed of when I was a child?"</i>.</p>
                    <p>This may sound depressing but it actually isn't - you have a choice! We're humans, we have the ability to reason and make conscious decisions.</p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <p class="quote-text">Time flies…but the good news is, you’re the pilot</p>
                        <p class="quote-author">Michael Altshuler</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Being able to make these kinds of decisions doesn't make life any easier though - it's both a blessing and a curse because now questions arouse that are arguably even harder to answer: What decisions should we actually make?</p>
                    <p>There is no general answer to that, everyone is different and unique. However, the questions I've mentionned above can be a framework, a guide that can help you when making decisions.</p>
