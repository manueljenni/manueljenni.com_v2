# manueljenni.com - v2
This is a rework of my website [manueljenni.com](https://manueljenni.com), 
using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
All the data is coming from [my own REST-API](https://github.com/manueljenni/web-api).

### Goals of the rework
- Give the website a more modern look
- Implement a JS framework and an API for data-fetching
- Add some cool features for the /travel page (interactive map, tables etc.)
- Improve performance / decrease loading times
- Learn how to use React & Tailwind
